Hello this is my first MERN stack application. It is a simple marketplace(bazaar) where users can submit their products to be displayed in a catalogue of wonderful creations.

About the Project
Bazaar is a marketplace app built with the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack. This application allows users to add products with images, descriptions, and prices, which are then displayed in a catalog. The purpose of this project is to practice and demonstrate skills in full-stack development using MERN technologies.
